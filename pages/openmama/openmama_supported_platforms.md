## Support Lifecycle
As OpenMAMA develops alongside infrastructures, the **project aims to support platforms for as long as production support is widely available from it's providers**. An example of this would be that of RHEL's first three [production phases](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata), during which OpenMAMA will be supported.

## Linux

- CentOS / RHEL 5 (x64)
- CentOS / RHEL 6 (x64)
- CentOS / RHEL 7 (x64)

Although not strictly supported, OpenMAMA does run on other Linux distros.
As long as OpenMAMA's [dependancies](https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/wiki/Building-on-Linux#dependencies) have been installed OpenMAMA should build and run.

Distros known to work are:

- Ubuntu (x64)
- Fedora (x64)

## Windows
Currently, the following Windows versions are supported:

- Windows 7 (x86 / x64)
- Windows 8 (x86 / x64)
- Windows 10 (x86 / x64)
- Windows Server 2008 R2 (x86 / x64)
- Windows Server 2012 (x86 / x64)
- Windows Server 2012 R2 (x86 / x64)

Furthermore, the following Visual Studio Versions are supported:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (VC10)
