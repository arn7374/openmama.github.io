Welcome to the home of all OpenMAMA related technical Documentation.

Here you will find all sorts of documentation relating to the project, including an overview of our [development process](openmama_development_process.html), [FAQ](openmama_faq.html), documentation on how to develop a middleware [bridge](openmama_bridge.html), as well as instructions for [building](openmama_build_instructions.html) OpenMAMA. 

## Quick Start 

We're currently working on various initiatives to make starting with OpenMAMA easier. This includes RPM packaging and updated quick start documentation. 

The current version of the quick start guide can be found [here](openmama_quick_start_guide_running_openmama_apps.html).

## Continuous Integration Environment

The latest version of the continuous integration environment can be found at [ci.openmama.org](http://ci.openmama.org).

## Other Resources

This is a work in progress so much of the documentation for OpenMAMA as it stands today is still pretty fragmented. You can
currently find documentation for OpenMAMA across several disparate sources:

* [The official OpenMAMA webpage](http://www.openmama.org/content/quick-start-guide) containing several succinct tutorials and quick start guides
* [The official OpenMAMA documentation](http://www.openmama.org/documentation) (reference and developer guide in PDF format)
* [The github wiki page](https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/wiki) (mainly focused at internal affairs and bridge development)

This has proven to be confusing to newcomers to the project so we have created this project with the primary goal of consolidating all official technical
documentation for OpenMAMA under one resource.

The project is built on [Tom Johnson's extremely impressive documentation theme for jekyll](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/).
