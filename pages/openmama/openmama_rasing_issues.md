Please take the following into discussion when raising issues:

* Check this hasn't been reported before. GitHub provides excellent search functionality on the main [issues](https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/issues) page.
* Include as much information as possible
    * Recreation details.
    * [Platform(s)](openmama_supported_platforms.html) seen on.
    * Relevant code snippets.
    * Example output.
* If you're planning on working on the issue yourself, let us know!
    * Comment on the issue to limit duplication of effort.
* Instead of an issue, consider opening a [Pull Request](https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr) if you already have code to look at.
    * Keeps all relevant information on one page.
