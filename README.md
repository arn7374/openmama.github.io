## OpenMAMA Technical Documentation Project

Welcome to the new home of all OpenMAMA related technical Documentation.

Much of the documentation for OpenMAMA as it stands today is pretty fragmented. You can
currently find documentation for OpenMAMA across several disparate sources:

* [The official OpenMAMA webpage](http://www.openmama.org/content/quick-start-guide) containing several succinct tutorials and quick start guides
* [The official OpenMAMA documentation](http://www.openmama.org/documentation) (reference and developer guide in PDF format)
* [The github wiki page](https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/wiki) (mainly focused at internal affairs and bridge development)

This has proven to be confusing to newcomers to the project so we have created this project with the primary goal of consolidating all official technical
documentation for OpenMAMA under one resource.

The project is built on [Tom Johnson's extremely impressive documentation theme for jekyll](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/).
